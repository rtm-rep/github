I'm gonna keep rollin' on (on)
No matter what the world may do (do)
'Cause with a love like this (like this)
There's nothing left to do (to do)
So let me tell you
It doesn't matter what you say, I'm still
I'm still gonna float away for real
In a minute, y'all, I'll be gone right or wrong
I'ma just keep rolling on and on
And on and on
No more wasting time (time)
I gotta get into this groove (groove)
'Cause with a love like this (like this)
I just can't help to move (move)
So let me tell you
It doesn't matter what you say, I'm still
I'm still gonna float away for real
In a minute, y'all, I'll be gone right or wrong
I'ma just keep rolling on and on
And on and on
It doesn't matter what you say, I'm still
I'm still gonna float away for real
In a minute, y'all, I'll be gone right or wrong
I'ma just keep rolling on and on
And on and on
